# FreshTrack

FreshTrack is a minimal grocery expiration tracking web application designed to help users reduce food waste and manage household spending.

The application allows users to add grocery items, monitor expiry dates, and view monthly impact insights — all within a calm, distraction-free interface.

## ✨ Features

- Add grocery items with name, category, expiry date, and cost
- Automatic categorization:
  - **Eat Soon** (expiring within 2 days)
  - **Fresh**
  - **Expired**
- Monthly impact tracking (Saved vs Wasted)
- Smart insights based on usage patterns
- LocalStorage persistence (data remains after refresh)
- Warm, minimal brown & beige design system

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

FreshTrack follows a warm, earthy color palette inspired by brown and beige tones to create a calm and grounded user experience.
